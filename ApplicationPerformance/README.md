Railo-Labs : Application Performance
==========

I found this very interesting, and insightful Blog Post (https://www.farbeyondcode.com/Incredible-Railo-application-start-up-performance-boost-using-ObjectLoad-ObjectSave-to-persist-shared-memory-scopes-5-2937.html)
about Railo Application Start-Up Perfomance Boosting.

As just, I took the Example Code from the Blog Post and Included it here in the Railo-Labs Application Performance Repository.

Thanks to Bruce KirkPatrick for this insightful Blog Post and awesome booster for performace.
