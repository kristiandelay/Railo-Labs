Railo-Labs : Errors
==========

This is a Modified and Reformatted Version of Railo's Error Output templates for a slightly nicer (and potentially) easier on the eyes Display
of Errors thrown from the Railo Server.

All of the Tables in the Templates have been updated to resemble the Twitter Bootstrap Tables.

Installation:
Copy these files into your Server's {webroot}/WEB-INF/railo/context/templates/error/ Folder.
